The Matlab library computes the density of the distance to a random
variable uniformly distributed in some sets and the area
of intersection of disks and balls with those sets.

All necessary files to run the functions of the library
are in folders Areas\Library and its subfolder
Examples which contains files to run the main functions
on examples. No external library is needed.

If the folder Areas\Libary is copied in folder
C:\Users\user\_name, before using the library, 
update the path  in Matlab with commands:

addpath 'C:\Users\user_name\Areas_Libary'
addpath 'C:\Users\user_name\Areas_Libary\Examples'
